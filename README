This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/cfpoi/ for Railo. 

A massive thank you must go out to Matt Woodward (matt@mattwoodward.com/@mpwoodward) as he has done all the hard work for this project I am just forking it to make it workable with Railo as an extension.

CFPOI is a set of CFML wrapper for the Apache POI Project. POI allows programmatic interaction with Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org documents via Java, and CFPOI provides CFML-based access to the majority of POI functionality, including the ability to read, write, and interact with spreadsheet, presentation, and word processing documents.

The CFML wrappers for POI consist of CFCs, user-defined functions (UDFs), and custom tags that allow various means and syntax styles for interacting with the various document types.
